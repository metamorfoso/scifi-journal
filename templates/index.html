          Sponge is an online magazine for science fiction and speculative fiction, based in the post-apocalpytic city
          of Christchurch, New Zealand. We publish short stories, poetry, and reviews of science fiction from New
          Zealand and Pacific writers, with a particular focus on new and emerging writers.
        </p>

          The magazine will soon be available to read online or to download as a pdf, mobi, or epub. We also plan to make an audio version of our magazine so if you are accepted to Sponge we will ask you to record a reading of your story. These will later be available for free on <a href="https://bandcamp.com">Band Camp</a>.
