          Sponge is an online magazine for science fiction and speculative fiction, based in the post-apocalpytic city
          of Christchurch, New Zealand. We publish short stories, poetry, and reviews of science fiction from New
          Zealand and Pacific writers, with a particular focus on new and emerging writers.

          The magazine will be available to read online or to download as a pdf or epub copy. We would also love to have
          audio versions of our magazine so if you love one of our stories, please record yourself reading it and send
          it to us at info@sponge.nz.
