          Sponge is an online journal for science fiction and speculative fiction, based in the
          post-apocalpytic city of Christchurch, New Zealand. We publish short stories, poetry,
          and reviews of science fiction from New Zealand and Pacific writers, with a particular
          focus on new and emerging writers.
        </p>

          The journal will soon be available to read online or to download as a pdf, mobi, or epub.
          We also plan to make an audio version of our journal so if you are accepted to Sponge we
          will ask you to record a reading of your story. These will later be available for free on
          <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="https://bandcamp.com">Band Camp</a>.
