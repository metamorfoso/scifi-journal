          Sponge is an online journal for science fiction and speculative fiction, based in the
          post-apocalpytic city of Christchurch, New Zealand. We publish short stories, poetry,
          and reviews of science fiction from New Zealand and Pacific writers, with a particular
          focus on new and emerging writers.
