        <p>Sponge is looking for original science fiction and speculative fiction from New Zealand and Pacific writers.
          This means that (for now) you can only submit to Sponge if you are a citizen of New Zealand or the Pacific, or
          if you are a resident of this area. If you are unsure whether this means you, please look at the map at the
          bottom of this page.</p>
        <p>You can submit to Sponge by filling out the submission form on this page. We are not picky about how you
          format your submission as long as it is clear and easy to read. To us this means:
          {#           <br/>#}
          {#           <br/>#}
          {#            - Left aligned text#}
          {#            <br/>#}
          {#             - A normal font like Times New Roman (or Courier if you prefer monospaced)#}
          {#             <br/>#}
          {#            - Consistent punctuation#}
          {#            <br/>#}
          {#            - And that's it!#}
        <ul>
          <li>Left aligned text</li>
          <li>A normal font like Times New Roman (or Courier if you prefer monospaced)</li>
          <li>Consistent punctuation</li>
          <li>And that's it!</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>You may submit you story as a doc, docx, txt, or rdf file (basically anything that is text readable). If you
          are submitting an artwork for our cover, please send through a web-quality png or jpeg file (atleast 500
          pixels on its widest length)</p>
        <p>At Sponge we are pretty flexible about what we consider a science fiction or speculative fiction story. It is
          not about what you do or do not put in your story, but the attitude you bring to your writing. We want to
          publish stories that are quirky and different, that play with form and push the boundaries of science fiction.
          Most importantly, we want to publish stories that say something about what it means to live in the Pacific and
          how our culture, society, and evironments shapes the stories we tell.</p>
